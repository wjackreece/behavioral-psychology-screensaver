# Project Onboarding: Behavioral Psychology Quote Screensaver

---

## Overview

This document serves as a complete onboarding guide for building a dynamic, fullscreen application that displays rotating quotes from philosophers and thinkers in behavioral psychology. It is designed for immediate use and structured execution.

---

## Mission

Design and build a dynamic screensaver-style application that displays curated quotes related to behavioral psychology.

The project focuses on:

- End-to-end software development practice
- Calm, intentional user experience design
- Clear code structure and maintainability
- Applying focused, high-leverage engineering time

---

## Success Criteria

The project is considered successful when it includes:

- A fullscreen application that displays rotating quotes
- Clear separation between data and application logic
- Readable, maintainable code
- A consistent, distraction-free interface
- Basic project documentation

---

## Onboarding Timeline

---

### Week 1: Environment Setup

**Objectives**

- Establish a working development environment
- Launch a fullscreen application window

**Tasks**

- Confirm Python installation
- Create project directory and files
- Implement a fullscreen window with a neutral background
- Add a reliable exit mechanism (Escape key)

**Completion Check**

- Application launches and exits correctly

---

### Week 2: Core Functionality

**Objectives**

- Display quotes dynamically
- Separate data from application logic

**Tasks**

- Create `quotes.py`
- Add at least 10 quotes with authors
- Implement random quote selection
- Display quote text and attribution
- Rotate quotes on a fixed time interval

**Completion Check**

- Quotes rotate correctly
- Code structure is clear and intentional

---

### Week 3: Interface Refinement

**Objectives**

- Improve readability and visual balance
- Ensure calm and consistent presentation

**Tasks**

- Adjust font size and spacing
- Enable text wrapping
- Center content vertically and horizontally
- Apply a restrained color palette
- Test readability at various distances

**Completion Check**

- Content is easy to read and visually balanced

---

### Week 4: Code Quality and Documentation

**Objectives**

- Improve maintainability
- Document decisions and learning

**Tasks**

- Add comments where intent is not obvious
- Remove unused code
- Refactor for clarity
- Write a `README.md`
- Document lessons learned in `notes.md`

**Completion Check**
